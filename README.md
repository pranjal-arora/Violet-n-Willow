## Error Handling added, after mentor discussions:-
- Error Page on accessing any protected route.
- For Checkout, always need to be signed in.
- Payment Options available only when valid billing address is entered

## Third Party API's used:-
- ***Stripe Payment Gateway-*** to process the customer's credit card information by sending the data to the gateway's web server, which then makes the sale and sends the confirmation back to the website.
- ***SendGrid Email Verification-*** to validate and verify user's Email. The SendGrid UI creates the Email Validation API Key.
